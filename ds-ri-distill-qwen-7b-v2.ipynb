      "1. **Identify the dimensions of the triangles:**\n",
      "   The problem states that the yard contains two congruent isosceles right triangles and the parallel sides of the trapezoidal remainder are $15$ meters and $25$ meters. The difference in length between the parallel sides of the trapezoid is $25 - 15 = 10$ meters. Since the triangles are congruent and isosceles right triangles, each triangle's legs are equal to half of this difference:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\text{Leg length of each triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5 \\text{ meters}\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Calculate the area of one triangle:**\n",
      "   The area \\(A\\) of an isosceles right triangle with leg length \\(a\\) is given by:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a^2\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "   Substituting \\(a = 5\\) meters:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 25 = \\frac{25}{2} \\text{ square meters}\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Calculate the total area of the flower beds:**\n",
      "   Since there are two such triangles:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\text{Total area of flower beds} = 2 \\times \\frac{25}{2} = 25 \\text{ square meters}\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Calculate the area of the entire yard:**\n",
      "   The yard is rectangular with length $25$ meters and width $5$ meters, so its area is:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\text{Area of the yard} = 25 \\times 5 = 125 \\text{ square meters}\n",
      "   \\]\n",

      "5. **Determine the fraction of the yard occupied by the flower beds:**\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\text{Fraction occupied by flower beds} = \\frac{\\text{Area of flower beds}}{\\text{Area of the yard}} = \\frac{25}{125} = \\frac{1}{5}\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the fraction of the yard occupied by the flower beds is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$. The answer is $\\mathrm{(C)}$.\n"
